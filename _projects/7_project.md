The research project titled "Explanation in Explainable Artificial Intelligence" aims to enhance the understanding of AI models by integrating insights from the philosophy of science. It focuses on two main objectives: firstly, to clarify the nature of 'explanation' within the emerging field of Explainable AI (XAI), and secondly, to establish a benchmark for assessing the quality of these explanations.

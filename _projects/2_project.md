The research project titled "Machine learning in natural science: bridging the gap from data to understanding" explores the intersection of machine learning, philosophy, and natural sciences. It aims to investigate how artificial intelligence can contribute to scientific understanding, especially in physics, by examining the construction of explanatory models and their intelligibility. The project brings together philosophers, computer scientists, and physicists to address fundamental questions about scientific understanding in the context of AI-driven science, paving the way for future interdisciplinary research in this field.

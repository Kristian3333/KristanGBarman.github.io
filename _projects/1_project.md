This project explored the field of engineering, particularly in the areas of failure analysis and accident causation. Utilizing philosophical concepts and examining case studies like the Air France 447 crash and the Samsung Galaxy 7 malfunctions, it scrutinized and refined explanatory methods within engineering. Additionally, the project successfully developed a new procedure to advance the efficacy of failure analysis, providing practical tools for critical evaluation and redesign in the realm of engineering science.
